## Problem

Given a start number a, an ending number b, and a string str that can be "odd", "even", or "prime", return all of the numbers that are odd, even, or prime between a and b. a will not always necessarily be less than b!

Example:

```js
betweenNums(3, 11, 'even')
[4,6,8,10]

betweenNums(15, 1, 'prime')
[2,3,5,7,11,13]
```
